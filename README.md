# Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data with STAR solo

Here we will describe the pipeline for processing raw single-cell RNA sequencing reads with [STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR). We also cover how to download publicly available scRNAseq data from the SRA database using the [SRA Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki).
